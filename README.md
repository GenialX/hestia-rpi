# Hestia

In Ancient Greek religion, Hestia (/ˈhɛstiə/; Greek: Ἑστία, "hearth" or "fireside") is a virgin goddess of the hearth, architecture, and the right ordering of domesticity, the family, the home, and the state.

So, Hestia is the project which controlls the devices in home smartly. Additionally, It also supports some extended functionality which is described in the [Feature (Brain Part)](https://github.com/GenialX/hestia-server#feature-brain-part).
